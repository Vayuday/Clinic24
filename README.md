Built the backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to handle user sign-up/login, store doctor profiles and
appointment details, and ensure only logged-in users can access those features.
Created a React.js frontend with Redux Toolkit and CSS to show pages for registering, logging in, browsing doctors,
booking or canceling appointments, and editing profiles.
Made an admin panel where an administrator can approve new doctors, view all users and doctors, send or delete
notifications, and oversee every appointment.
